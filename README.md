# DESCRIPTION

Photo Bingo is a bit of a mix between Apples to Apples,
and casual social games like Words with Friends. I envision it as a 
mobile game, though it is obviously not currently implemented as one.
A player selects (or makes) a theme, which contains a bunch of related
phrases. For example, the “Cars” theme may contain many different makes
and models of cars. He and his invited friends are each given a 4x4 grid,
populated with randomly selected and ordered cars.

They race to take pictures
of the corresponding cars, and upload them to the database. A picture must be
“approved” by the other players, to verify that it is, indeed, a picture of a
(for example) Lamborghini, rather than one of a Ford. This is done by vote.
When a player gets 4 approved pictures in a row, column, or diagonal, he is
declared the winner, and all boards become available to all players for perusal.
